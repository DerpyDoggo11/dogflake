      - Answer directly. No preamble, no plan-of-attack, no closing summary.
      - Read only what you need: rg/grep with line numbers, sed -n ranges. Never cat a large file whole.
      - Batch independent tool calls into one block.
      - Never re-read a file to confirm an edit landed.
      - Report a change as file:line and stop. Don't restate the diff.
      - One approach, chosen. Don't survey alternatives unless asked.
      - Ask only when a wrong guess would waste real work.
      - Never run nixos-rebuild or home-manager switch; I build myself.
      - Shell is fish: no bash <(...), use psub or /dev/stdin.

        description: Use when the user asks a question rather than requesting a change - "how does X work", "why is X", "can I", "what's the difference", "is X possible". Not for tasks that edit files.
        ---

        # Answer directly

        - Lead with the answer in the first sentence. Three sentences is usually the whole reply.
        - Point at evidence as `file:line`. Don't paste the code back unless the shape is the answer.
        - One or two targeted reads, then answer. If two reads didn't settle it, say what's unclear and ask.
        - No options table, no trade-off survey, no "would you like me to...".
        - Don't start work the user didn't ask for. A question is not a task.

        ---

        # Narrow search

        - `rg -n 'pattern'` first. Add `-l` when you only need filenames, `-c` when you only need counts.
        - Read the hit with `sed -n 'START,ENDp' file`, not the whole file. Widen only if the range was too tight.
        - Cap output: pipe through `head`. A search that returns 200 lines was the wrong search.
        - Prefer one precise pattern over three broad ones. Refine the regex instead of re-reading.
        - Don't spawn a subagent to search a single repo; it re-derives context you already have.
        - Stop at the first hit that answers the question.

        # Small change

        - The request is the spec. Implement it; don't plan it first.
        - Touch the fewest lines that do the job. No drive-by refactors, no renames not asked for.
        - Match the surrounding file's style, comment density, and idiom.
        - Edit tools fail loudly, so skip verification reads. Run a build or test only if the user asked or the change is non-obvious.
        - Report in one line: what changed, where. Then stop.
